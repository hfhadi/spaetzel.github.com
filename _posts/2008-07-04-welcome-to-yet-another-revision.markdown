I've been wanting to update my blog to use Wordpress for a while now. After the frustration of dealing with the complexity of Drupal and the weirdness of DasBlog, it is awfully nice now to have the mainstream blogging software powering by blog.

I just switched my web host to Mosso that allows me to run both Windows and Linux servers off of the same account. This gives me the flexibility to use any technology that best suits my needs.

I'll be moving CastRoller over to this server over the weekend.
