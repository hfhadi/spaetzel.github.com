She wanted to interview me for an article she was writing on Twitter.

She selected me because of the <a href="http://twitter.com/waterloomeetup">Waterloo Twitter meetup</a> that I organized in April. She said that her brother gave her the idea for the article.

We had an enjoyable conversation about what Twitter is, what you can do with it and what people have gained by taking part in the conversation on Twitter.
