Ever since Google <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2006/09/google-reader-switches-to-bloglines.html">launched </a>the 2nd version of <a class="zem_slink" title="Google Reader" rel="homepage" href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google reader</a>, I have been using it exclusively as my feed reader. At one point I had over 700 feeds in reader, but usually I kept it around 300 feeds.

I've been finding that I haven't been actually reading most of the posts in my feeds. I get far too many posts coming in one day that I don't have the time to read them all, I needed a solution; a better way to read my feeds and ensure that I read the good stuff, and don't waste my time with anything else. I wanted to join the conversation and see the conversation that is happening on the web. Enter <a class="zem_slink" title="FriendFeed" rel="homepage" href="http://friendfeed.com/">FriendFeed</a>.

On FriendFeed, I was able to add the people that I care about, and have everything that they publish to the web appear in one place. FriendFeed has a large number of controls that let you filter what it shows to you, and it automatically sorts the items in your feed to keep the items that have the most conversation on them appear at the top.

I have now set FriendFeed as my homepage and now I can see what is happening with the people I care about quickly and keep myself involved in the conversation.

I haven't completely abandoned Google Reader but I am now using it much less and have only kept the Feeds that I want to read 100% of the posts. I now only have about 70 feeds in GReader.

In an upcoming post, I'll list off the <a class="zem_slink" title="Greasemonkey" rel="homepage" href="http://www.greasespot.net/">GreaseMonkey</a> scripts that I use to make FriendFeed even more useful.
