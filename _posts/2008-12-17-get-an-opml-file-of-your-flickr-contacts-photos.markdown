title: Get an OPML File of your Flickr Contacts' Photos

I find it difficult to keep up with all of my <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> contacts' photos through the RSS feeds that Flickr provides. It is too easy to miss good photos when you subscribe to the main Contacts feed from Flickr. And it is too annoying to subscribe to each individual feed in my reader.

So I came up with the idea to write a tool that generates an OPML file for each of my contacts. That would certainly be better, that way I can choose to see all the photos from all my contacts, or browse each contact individually in Google Reader. And I could use this <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/spaetzel/flickrlargepostrank">Yahoo Pipe </a>that also manipulates the feed to give you larger photos instead of the thumbnail, and filters the photos using <a href="http://postrank.com">PostRank</a> to get just the best photos.

The tool is here: <a href="http://flickropml.spaetzel.com">flickropml.spaetzel.com</a>. You just have to give the tool your Flickr ID, and it will generate an OPML ready for you to import into your reader of choice.
