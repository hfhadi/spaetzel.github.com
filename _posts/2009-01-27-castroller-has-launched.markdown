After first having the idea for CastRoller while communing home in August, 2006, I have finally finished <a href="http://castroller.com">CastRoller </a>and launched it to the public.
<p style="text-align: left;"><a title="CastRoller Home Page by William Spaetzel, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/redune/3230922964/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3357/3230922964_cc933dcfcb.jpg" alt="CastRoller Home Page" width="500" height="232" /></a>
Building the site has been a long, but enjoyable process. After lots of feedback from many different people causing me to go through three major revisions of the site, I've really learned a lot about what it takes to build an intutive and enjoyable website.
<p style="text-align: left;">I hope that many of you will give the site a try and of course keep coming back to the site that I am incredibly proud of. I look forward to seeing you on the site and hearing your feedback.</p>
