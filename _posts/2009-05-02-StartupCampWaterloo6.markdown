Software watches when a file changes and by whom. Only store fingerprints, not making copies of the files. Web interface shows alerts for changes to files. Source of the client software is available to audit. Not able to track who made the change.

First impression is that is looks a lot like [Google Wave](http://wave.google.com). They plan to take advantage of the Wave API. You can put up links and have comments from your 
collaborators on the links. Shows thumbnails (from websnapr/mister-wong.com). 

Want a Fremium model. Premium accounts could have export or file uploading. Apparently looks like Brainpark, also similar to Primar Fusion.

[NeverBored Studios]

iPhone game. Side scroller/puzzle. Trying to find ways to market app.
