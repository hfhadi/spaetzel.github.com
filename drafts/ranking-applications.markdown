title: Ranking Applications in the new Application Center
---

With the new [application center][appcenter], the number one goal is to make sure that our users see the best content. 
On many pages, including the [home page][appcenter], the [MapleSim content page](http://www.maplesoft.com/applications/maplesim)
and the [Tips & Techniques](http://www.maplesoft.com/applications/tipsandtechniques), our editors can control the 
ordering of the applications, but with almost 2000 applications, editor's cannot rank all of the applications.

Fortunately, by simply using the Application Center, our users have helped to rank all of the rest of the applications. 
We can use the statistics such as page views, downloads and user rating to calculate the "popularity" of applications.

Here are the statistics available for us to use to calculate the popularity:
- v - The number of times the application details page has been viewed
- d - The number of times the application file has been downloaded
- a - The average of all user ratings the application has received
- nr - The number of times the application has been rated
- days - The number of days since the application was published
